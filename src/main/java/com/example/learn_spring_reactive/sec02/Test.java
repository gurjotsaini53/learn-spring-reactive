ðŸš€ Java Developers: Have You Noticed This Integer Quirk?



        ðŸ¤” Why does this happen?

Java uses a concept called Integer Caching to optimize memory for frequently used values.

For integers between -128 and 127, Java maintains a cache, and variables within this range point to the same object in memory. Hence, x == y is true.

For integers outside this range (e.g., 128), new objects are created, so a == b is false as they reference different objects.

ðŸ’¡ Key takeaway:

When comparing wrapper types like Integer, always use .equals() for value comparison instead of ==, unless you're certain about the caching behavior.
